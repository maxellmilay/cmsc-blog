    description: `	  Everyone's life is shaped by their time in school, a critical stage for students. It is a setting where we acquire the academic material and crucial life skills like critical thinking, teamwork, and communication. However, as the proverb goes, "Starting is always the hardest part, but once you get through that, everything else falls into place." This blog will discuss how our first day of school went, including the difficulties we encountered, the opportunities we had, and the effects it had on our general well-being.

	  At one of the best schools in the country, there is a buzz of anticipation in the air as students and parents alike get ready for the first day of class. Warm light from the rising sun illuminates the campus as neatly dressed students of all ages stream through the gates and proceed to the campus tour. When new friendships are made and old ones are rekindled, laughing, conversation, and the occasional nervous chuckle fill the air. The tone for a year of study and development is established by the vibrant displays of student artwork and motivational sayings that adorn the hallways. There is a sense of exhilaration and anticipation as the first session begins for the chances and difficulties that lie ahead.

Student A POV

	  One of the difficulties we encounter is widening our connections or making new friends within the school vicinity. Meddling in and talking to a group of people can be a challenging task, as there are a variety of factors that can complicate the communication process. For starters, one of us doesn’t have a previous schoolmate to talk to, he was the only one who passed the UPCA from his previous school. Communicating with people who are in groups is difficult to establish, groups may have their own established dynamics, power structures, and ways of communicating that can be difficult to navigate if you're an outsider or new to the group.

Student B POV

    The week after vacation, or the first week of school or work is a time period where one might feel anxious since classes are soon to start again; one might be chilling since the first week is usually for course orientation; or maybe there are others who haven’t gotten over their vacation mindset. I am personally the person who is chilling since I bet on the fact that there are no formal classes yet. I treat it as a transition between vacation and work, so it’s also a time where I start planning how my semester will go depending on my schedule.

    However, there is something different about the first week of this semester, since most of the classes, if not all, are already meeting face-to-face. This means that more students will be on campus, thus more chances of socializing with classmates and schoolmates. For some, it will be nervous since they might be shuffled into a different set of classes with their friends, and for some, it will be an experience to look forward to since they will be meeting their friends as schoolmates or classmates most of the time. I’m still not sure where I stand, but I am leaning on looking forward to creating memorable experiences with my peers.

Student C POV
	
	  Starting a new semester is actually very exciting for us students. This is when students get to meet each other again and also meet new people. Adjusting to the new schedules and assigned rooms may be difficult at first. Although they would say the beginning is hard at first but the first week of a new semester is just the calm before the storm. It would seem that students get to be oriented with their particular subjects at first but when the actual lesson begins, the hard part is about to start.

	  I actually had it difficult during the first day because I had just recently got discharged from the hospital. My health didn’t stop me from going to school because it is just as important too. Some friends were worried about how I looked thinner than before. So I had to clarify that I was admitted to the hospital about a few days ago. I actually was excited that they would announce the opening of the new building but sadly it is still not available. My first day is much as difficult as the previous semester since I have to walk fairly far from the dormitory just to get to my class. Even as a dormer inside the campus, you would feel the tiredness of crossing around the campus just to get to your assigned classrooms. As usual, the room is tiny and not tidy. A simple conversation in class would make a noise far greater than the teacher's. Although things are the same as usual, I am happy that I am able to learn with my friends. The laughs would circle around the class and we would vibe together with the teacher.

	  The first day ended fast as usual just like any other day. However, the first day is much as important as any other day. We, students, have to enjoy any moment in class because each day things change. We would always have ups and downs during the semester but helping each other made us survive through the previous one and how much more for this new semester. As students, we look forward to the new lessons we could learn in school. Although it was challenging for us before the first day, we were actually happy and grateful that we were able to attend the first day.
